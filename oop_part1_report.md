## Task 1: Write the Horse Class according to specifications

### Encapsulation Explaination

Explain how encapsulation is used to safeguard data in your class. Specifically, point out which methods are accessor (getter) methods, and which are mutator (setter) methods. You should explain how these methods work together to ensure that the horse’s data is both accessible and protected from unwanted changes.

### Testing Evidence

Include screenshots of your tests with detailed explanations. Describe the tests you conducted to verify the correctness of each method, such as testing the moveForward() and fall() methods, or ensuring that confidence cannot exceed the allowed bounds (0 to 1).



## Task 2: Improve the Race class

• List identified issues and explain them.

• Provide updated code for your Race class with explanations of changes.
